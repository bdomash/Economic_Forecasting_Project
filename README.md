Final Project for Econ 460: Economic Forecasting, using STATA

Me and my partner used STATA to forecast the number of mining and logging employees in November 2018, using data from FRED. 

The series of graphs can be found here in either pdf or gph formats, and the final project with our analysis is also included.
